# Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your AI Writing Assistant to GitHub and Streamlit Cloud.

## üöÄ GitHub Deployment

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Writing Assistant"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., `ai-writing-assistant`)
4. Make it public or private (your choice)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (since you already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands. Use the ones above or follow GitHub's instructions.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare for Streamlit Cloud

Your app is already configured for Streamlit Cloud with:
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
- ‚úÖ `.streamlit/config.toml` for deployment settings

3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME`
5. Set the main file path: `app.py`
6. Click "Deploy!"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

After deployment, you need to add your Google API key:

1. In your Streamlit Cloud dashboard, go to your app
2. Click "Settings" (gear icon)
3. Go to "Secrets"
4. Add your Google API key:
   ```toml
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key-here"
   ```
5. Click "Save"

## üîß Alternative Deployment Options

### Heroku Deployment

1. Create a `Procfile`:
   ```
   web: streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0
   ```

2. Add Heroku buildpack:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python
   ```

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

### Railway Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
3. Add environment variable: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
4. Deploy!
